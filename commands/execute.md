# /execute

Execute a specification using a Ralph loop with subagent delegation.

## Usage

```bash
/execute                              # Uses docs/SPEC.md or finds latest in docs/specs/
/execute docs/specs/user-auth.spec.md # Execute specific spec
/execute --max-iterations 50          # Limit iterations (default: 100)
```

## Multi-Agent Mode

When running multiple agents in parallel, use `--agent-id` to isolate each agent:

```bash
# Terminal 1                          # Terminal 2
/execute --agent-id 1                  /execute --agent-id 2
```

Each agent gets:
- Own git worktree: `.worktrees/agent-{id}/`
- Own branch: `execution-agent-{id}`
- Own progress file: `docs/PROGRESS.md` (isolated in worktree)
- Own Ralph state: `.claude/ralph-loop.local.md` (isolated in worktree)

SPEC.md is copied to each worktree as read-only source of truth.

## Your Role: ORCHESTRATOR
You are the orchestrator. You DO NOT write code directly.
You delegate ALL implementation work to subagents via the Task tool.

## Each Iteration:
1. READ: $SPEC_PATH (requirements), docs/PROGRESS.md (status)
2. FIND: First PENDING requirement
3. DELEGATE: Use Task tool to spawn implementation subagent:
   - Subagent type: backend-engineer or frontend-engineer (as appropriate)
   - Give it the specific requirement to implement
   - Include relevant file paths and context
4. VERIFY: Check subagent's work (tests pass, code correct)
5. UPDATE: Mark requirement COMPLETED in PROGRESS.md
6. REPEAT: Until all requirements done

## Subagent Prompt Template:
\"Implement [REQ-X] from $SPEC_PATH.
Requirement: [copy requirement text]
Follow TDD: write failing test first, then implement, then refactor.
Relevant files: [list key files]
When done, ensure tests pass.\"

## Completion:
FINAL CHECK: All tests pass, build clean, lint clean
THEN: <promise>ALL_REQUIREMENTS_VERIFIED</promise>

If blocked: <promise>BLOCKED: [reason]</promise>"

## TDD Protocol

For each requirement, follow RED → GREEN → REFACTOR:

### RED: Write Failing Test First
```
1. Write test that describes expected behavior
2. Run test - it MUST fail
3. If test passes, you're testing existing behavior - rewrite
```

### GREEN: Minimal Implementation
```
1. Write simplest code to make test pass
2. No extras, no gold-plating
3. Verify test passes
```

### REFACTOR: Clean Up
```
1. Only refactor when tests are GREEN
2. Keep tests passing throughout
3. Commit when done
```

---

## Progress Tracking

After each requirement, update `docs/PROGRESS.md`:

```markdown
## Requirements Status

| ID | Requirement | Status | Notes |
|----|-------------|--------|-------|
| REQ-1 | [name] | COMPLETED | [iteration notes] |
| REQ-2 | [name] | IN_PROGRESS | - |
| REQ-3 | [name] | PENDING | - |
```

---

## Verification Gate

Before claiming completion, run and show output:

```bash
# Tests
npm test  # or pytest, go test, etc.

# Build
npm run build

# Lint
npm run lint
```

All must pass with actual output shown.

---

## Completion

When ALL requirements verified:

```
<promise>ALL_REQUIREMENTS_VERIFIED</promise>
```

If genuinely blocked:

```
<promise>BLOCKED: [specific reason]</promise>
```

---

## Multi-Agent Completion

When running as an agent in a worktree:

1. Complete all requirements with passing tests
2. Create `docs/RESULTS.md` summarizing:
   - What was implemented
   - Test coverage achieved
   - Any deviations from spec
   - Recommended merge strategy

3. Output completion promise
4. User reviews and merges preferred implementation

---

## Iron Laws

1. **SPEC is ground truth** - Read it each iteration
2. **Orchestrate, don't implement** - Delegate to subagents via Task tool
3. **No code without failing test** - TDD always (subagents follow this)
4. **Verify before claiming** - Check subagent work, show actual output
5. **Update progress continuously** - State lives in files
6. **Do not lie to exit** - Promise must be TRUE
